* TODO Quality of Code
*** DONE Is the code functional?
***** DONE The model provided can be used to successfully operate the simulation.
*** TODO Is the code usable and readable?
***** DONE The code in =model.py= uses a Python generator.
***** DONE The =model.py= code is clearly organized.
***** DONE The =model.py= code has comments included where needed.
* TODO Model Architecture and Training Strategy
*** DONE Has an appropriate model architecture been employed for the task?
***** DONE The data is normalized in the model.
***** DONE The neural network uses convolution layers with appropriate filter sizes.
***** DONE Layers exist to introduce nonlinearity into the model.
*** DONE Has an attempt been made to reduce overfitting of the model?
***** DONE Train/validation/test splits have been used.
***** DONE The model uses dropout layers or other methods to reduce overfitting.
*** TODO Have the model parameters been tuned appropriately?
***** DONE Learning rate parameters are chosen with explanation, or an Adam optimizer is used.
*** DONE Is the training data chosen appropriately?
***** DONE Training data has been chosen to induce the desired behavior in the simulation (i.e. keeping the car on the track).
* TODO Architecture and Training Documentation
*** TODO Is the solution design documented?
***** TODO The README thoroughly discusses the approach taken for deriving and designing a model architecture fit for solving the given problem.
*** TODO Is the model architecture documented?
***** TODO The README provides sufficient details of the characteristics and qualities of the architecture:
      1. type of model
      2. number of layers
      3. size of each layer
      4. Visualizations emphasizing particular qualities of the architecture
*** TODO Is the creation of the training dataset and training process documented?
***** TODO The README describes how the model was trained.
***** TODO The README describes what the characteristics of the dataset are.
***** TODO Include information such as how the dataset was generated and examples of images from the dataset.
* TODO Simulation
*** TODO Is the car able to navigate correctly on test data?
***** TODO No tire may leave the drivable portion of the track surface.
***** TODO The car may not pop up onto ledges or roll over any surfaces that would otherwise be considered unsafe.
