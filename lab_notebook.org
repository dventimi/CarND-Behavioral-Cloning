*** Splitting data into validation sets
    - No need for train_test_split, I think.  I think I can just use
      the =validation_split= argument of =model.fit=.
    - However, evidently the data aren't shuffled.  May have to figure
      out how to do that, or maybe not.
*** Shuffling the data during training.
    - No need for external tools.  I think I can just use the
      =shuffle= argument in =model.fit=.
